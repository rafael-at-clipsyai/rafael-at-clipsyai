- 👋 Hi, I’m Rafael Pivato! Using this account to work at new exciting product here at Clipsy! 
- 👀 We are in very early stages so I am looking for best ways to achieve our underlying technical needs.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying some Kubernetes and Dockerized environments to run our most basic set of services.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video processing initiatives and simple service discovery solutions.
- 📫 You can send an email to rafael@clipsyai.com and I will reply as soon as possible.
